    <p>I graduated from Portland State University in 2017 with a Bachelor’s in English and a creative writing minor. For the last eight months I’ve been working at Rinella Produce as a warehouse supervisor/accounts receivable assistant, and I’ve also helped them with their social media accounts and hiring. I decided to join Epicodus because I would like to eventually help websites create more beautiful, user-friendly websites, but I am also very interested in learning as much as I can about other areas of coding as well. In my free time I enjoy playing basketball, writing poetry, and working on creative projects with my friends. I also enjoy visiting new breweries and going on hikes throughout Oregon. </p>

<h2>Projects Completed at Epicodus</h2>
<p>Throughout my time at Epicodus, we have worked on a variety of projects, many of them focused on learning specific skills associated with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. Here is a list of some that I have worked on: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Queen Page</li>
  <p>This project was another HTML and CSS practice, with this one focusing on “floats” and columns. The “random facts” about the band Queen are from https://ohfact.com/interesting-facts-about-band-queen/ , and each column repeats the same facts (we did this in order to save time and focus on styling instead of finding the perfect content). Later, I added more styling to the background and placed a youtube video of their song “Under Pressure” at the bottom of the page just for fun.
  </p>
  <li>Cupcake Shop</li>
  <p>This page was created in order to practice styling, more specifically CSS “classes.” For this particular page, I created two classes for altering text — “.flashy” and .”best” — and a third for altering the image of the “best cupcake.”</p>
  <li>Cookie Recipe</li>
  <p>This was a quick page that we made in class to practice “cloning” content from git hub to our own files. This page doesn’t have any CSS, but it does include different HTML elements such as: "h1" and "h2" tags; a random image; an external link to allrecipes.com; italic and bold text, and two different lists. Most of the recipe itself was supplied in the lesson, so I can’t take any credit even though I’m sure the cookies are delicious.
