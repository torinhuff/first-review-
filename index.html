    <h1>Torin Huff</h1>
    <p>I graduated from Portland State University in 2017 with a Bachelor’s in English and a creative writing minor. For the last eight months I’ve been working at Rinella Produce as a warehouse supervisor/accounts receivable assistant, and I’ve also helped them with their social media accounts and hiring. I decided to join Epicodus because I would like to eventually help websites create more beautiful, user-friendly websites, but I am also very interested in learning as much as I can about other areas of coding as well. In my free time I enjoy playing basketball, writing poetry, and working on creative projects with my friends. I also enjoy visiting new breweries and going on hikes throughout Oregon. </p>

<h2>Projects Completed at Epicodus</h2>
<ul>Throughout my time at Epicodus, we have worked on a variety of projects, many of them focused on learning specific skills. Here is a list of some that I have worked on: </ul>
<li>Queen Page</li>
<p>This project was another HTML and CSS practice, with this one focusing on “floats” and columns. The “random facts” about the band Queen are from https://ohfact.com/interesting-facts-about-band-queen/ , and each column repeats the same facts (we did this in order to save time and focus on styling instead of finding the perfect content). Later, I added more styling to the background and placed a youtube video of their song “Under Pressure” at the bottom of the page just for fun.
