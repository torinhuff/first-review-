  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I graduated from Portland State University in 2017 with a Bachelor’s in English and a creative writing minor. For the last eight months I’ve been working at Rinella Produce as a warehouse supervisor/accounts receivable assistant, and I’ve also helped them with their social media accounts and hiring. I decided to join Epicodus because I would like to eventually help websites create more beautiful, user-friendly websites, but I am also very interested in learning as much as I can about other areas of coding as well. In my free time I enjoy playing basketball, writing poetry, and working on creative projects with my friends. I also enjoy visiting new breweries and going on hikes throughout Oregon. </p>

<h2>Projects Completed at Epicodus</h2>
<p>Throughout my time at Epicodus, we have worked on a variety of projects, many of them focused on learning specific skills associated with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. Here is a list of some that I have worked on: </p>
</div>
<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-4">
  <h3><a href="https://github.com/torinhuff/queen-page">Queen Page</a></h3>
  <ul>
  <li>This project was another HTML and CSS practice, with this one focusing on “floats” and columns. The “random facts” about the band Queen are from <a href="https://ohfact.com/interesting-facts-about-band-queen/">here</a> , and each column repeats the same facts (we did this in order to save time and focus on styling instead of finding the perfect content). Later, I added more styling to the background and placed a youtube video of their song “Under Pressure” at the bottom of the page just for fun.
  </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-4">
  <h3><a href="https://github.com/torinhuff/cupcake-shop">Cupcake Shop</a></h3>
  <ul>
  <li>This page was created in order to practice styling, more specifically CSS “classes.” For this particular page, I created two classes for altering text — “.flashy” and .”best” — and a third for altering the image of the “best cupcake.”</li>
  <li>Uses: HTML, CSS</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-4">
  <h3><a href="https://github.com/torinhuff/cookie-recipe">Cookie Recipe</a></h3>
</ul>
  <li>This was a quick page that we made in class to practice “cloning” content from git hub to our own files. This page doesn’t have any CSS, but it does include different HTML elements such as: "h1" and "h2" tags; a random image; an external link to allrecipes.com; italic and bold text, and two different lists. Most of the recipe itself was supplied in the lesson, so I can’t take any credit even though I’m sure the cookies are delicious. We also created a README for this recipe.</li>
  <li>Uses: HTML and Markdown</li>
</ul>

<div class="col-sm-4">
  <h3><a href="https://github.com/torinhuff/torins-dog">Torin's Dog Charlie</a></h3>
  <ul>
  <li>For this project we created a page for our pets. I created one for my dog Charlie, and it lists just a few facts about her. It was good practice for styling headers, images, and the page itself using CSS. I also created a README for this page.</li>
  <li>Uses: HTML, CSS, Markdown</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-4">
  <h3><a href="https://github.com/torinhuff/boring-lecture">Boring Lecture</a></h3>
  <ul>
  <li>This was a site created to practice styling using classes, as well as elements tied to specific classes. FOr example, I created the class "intro" but I styled the image in that class using "img.intro". The text from this site comes from an <a href="https://loremipsum.io/ultimate-list-of-lorem-ipsum-generators/">"Office Ipsum" generator</a></li>
  <li>Uses: HTML, CSS</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-4">
  <h3><a href="https://github.com/torinhuff/animal-shelter">Animal Shelter</a></h3>
  <li>This is a fake "animal shelter" that allows someone to look into adopting different types of bears, both real and prehistoric. This allowed me to practice the box model, creating columns, cascading, styling, and using media queries.</li>
  <li>Uses: HTML, CSS</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-4">
  <h3><a href"https://github.com/torinhuff/wikipedia-page">Wikipedia Page</a></h3>
  <li>This was a fun project where we tried to recreate the Wikipedia page. Our time was limited, but it was a lot of fun because we got to see how various groups approached copying the design. Some people used more CSS, while others used Bootstrap to recreate the boxes of information.</li>
  <li>Uses: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-4">
  <h3><a href="https://github.com/torinhuff/week-in-review">Week in Review</a></h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Our first practice using Bootstrap! We created rows, columns, panels, and styled the header using the "jumbotron" feature.</li>
  <li>Uses: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-4">
  <h3><a href="https://github.com/torinhuff/blogging-site">Blogging Site</a></h3>
  <ul>
  <li>This was created to practice creating "classes" and styling our HTML text with CSS. We changed one group of text to "red" and another group to "blue" font.</li>
  <li>Uses: HTML, CSS</li>
</ul>

  <h3><a href="https://github.com/torinhuff/week-two-monday">Week 2 Monday</a></h3>
  <ul>
  <li>This repository contains two projects: "My first webpage" and "My favorite things". These projects showed us how to add block elements and style our elements using inline styling in HTML.</li>
  <li>Uses: HTML</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-4">
  <h3><a href="https://github.com/torinhuff/media-query-practice">Media Query Practice</a></h3>
  <ul>
  <li>This page was built just to practice using media queries. The page will change colors based on the width of the window.</li>
  <li>Uses: HTML, CSS</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-4">
  <h3><a href="https://github.com/torinhuff/-markdown">Markdown Practice</a></h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Our first practice creating README's. This is just a "Vacation" page created using markdown language, and the content was already provided for us.</li>
  <li>Uses: Markdown</li>

  <h3><a href="https://github.com/torinhuff/goodbye">Goodbye</a></h3>

  <h3><a href="https://github.com/torinhuff/hello-world">Hello World</a></h3>
